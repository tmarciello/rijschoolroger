Kahuna is the big kahuna among WordPress themes. It proved itself with an exotic design, effective and easy to use customizer settings and a responsive, fully editable layout. Many personal and business sites have embraced it for a wide spectrum of uses, ranging from portfolio and photography sites to blogs and online shops. The features are too many to list but here are some of the main attractions: translatable, search engine optimized (both microformats and micordata), supports RTL (right-to-left) languages, supports eCommerce (WooCommerce), has both wide and boxed layouts, masonry bricks, socials, Google fonts, typography options, and a great customizable landing page.
